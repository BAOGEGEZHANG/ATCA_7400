general dirctory -

This directory contains the top-level header and source code for 
API's for driver, device and port components of Arsenal driver 
software. In addition, it contains support for a few more API's 
that are related to MPIF block. The source files are named
accordingly.

This directory has both, private(driver internal use only) as well
as public(customer and driver use) header files.

The private header files are solely for the driver internal use 
only and nothing is exported for the customer use from these. 

Te public header files, in general are of two types - 
arn_xxx_data.h contain public data-structures, type defines,
               macro's, etc..
arn_xxx_api.h contain public API proto-types(as externs).
