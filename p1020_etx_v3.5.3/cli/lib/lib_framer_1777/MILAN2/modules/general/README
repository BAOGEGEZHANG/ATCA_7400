Header files:
m2r_cb.h	: PRIVATE header file - no need for other modules to 
		  explicitly include this file. 
		  Contains driver/device/port control blocks and other 
		  data structures.

m2r_common.h	: PRIVATE header file - other modules would need to include
		  this(should come immediately after the include of platform  
		  header files). This header file includes m2r_cb.h.
		  Contains some defines, macros, inline functions for 
		  access to control blocks and data structures.
          
m2r_public.h	: PUBLIC header file - other modules will require this 
		  header file. It does not include any of the
		  private header files.
		  Contains typedef's, defines, etc. which will be used 
		  for API arguments. 
		  This could be included in the top header file(in MILAN2
		  and ROMA directories) - may not be necessary to 
		  include it there explicitly as other header files will
		  be including it. If included, it should be somewhere at
		  the top of the include list.

m2r_gen.h       : PUBLIC header file for the general module. 
		  It does not include any of the private header files.
		  Contains public data structures and API's.      
		  This internally will include other modules public header
		  files as the data structures here are made up of 
		  Other modules do not need to include this one. But if 
		  they do, then they have to make sure that their include
		  paths(-I switch in Makefile) is set up properly based
		  on what module public header files this includes.
		  individual structures in other modules.
		  This should be at the bottom of the list in the top
		  header file(in MILAN2 and ROMA directories).
